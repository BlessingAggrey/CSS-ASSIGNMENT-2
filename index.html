      My name is <b>Blessing Chinazaekpere DeNwigwe-Aggrey</b>, I'm a
      <i>soon to be techie</i> and here's what I love about technology:
      Technology focuses on <b>breaking new grounds</b>, innovations, problems
      and solutions to those problems. It requires research, it requires
      consistency, and that is what makes it exciting for me. Technology is one
      sector that isn't going anywhere because there will always be innovations
      and creative ideas. Working in a tech environment also leaves room for
      growth and advancement.

      So far in the <b>Stutern software development program</b> we were taught
      how to create a repository on <i>Github</i>, how to fork repositories,
      create branches, make pull requests and how to push files from your
      desktop to your remote repository via <i>Gitbash</i>. I have learned about
      <i> Html and html tags</i>, how html is the structure of a web page. I
      have also recently learned about CSS, how one can use CSS to style a web
      page and make it beautiful. CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and
      it creates a great user experience.
      <b>Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye</b> and likely
      much harder to navigate. In addition to layout and format, CSS is
      responsible for font color and more.

      In CSS, <b>padding</b> is the <i>inner space</i> between the content and
      the border of your box.<b>Border</b> is the <i>perimeter</i> of the box.
      Borders can be invisible or they could be a thick colored line.
      <b>Margin</b> is the <i>outer space</i> or lack of space surrounding the
      box.
